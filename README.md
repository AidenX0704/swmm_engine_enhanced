# swmm_engine_enhanced

The enhanced version of SWMM engine is modified based on swmm_engine 5.2.4. It aims to provide users with more powerful and convenient data analysis capabilities. In addition to the original functions of swmm_engine 5.2.4, this enhanced version has added functions such as time series generation and visual data generation.

The time series generation function allows users to obtain detailed time-varying data of various parameters, which is crucial for understanding the dynamic changes of the water system model. The visual data generation function further transforms the complex data into intuitive graphical forms, such as graphs and charts, enabling users to quickly and accurately grasp the characteristics and trends of the data. These added functions are convenient for users to analyze data, facilitating in-depth research and decision-making in the field of water resource management and urban drainage systems.

# Update Plan

- Currently, the complete node time series output has been achieved. This enables users to comprehensively understand the temporal variation of node-related parameters.

- In the next stage, we will focus on completing the time series output for the pipe network. This will involve enhancing the algorithm and data processing related to the pipe network to ensure accurate and detailed time series data of parameters such as flow rate and pressure within the pipe network can be obtained.

- Subsequently, we plan to improve the visual data generation function for the pipe network. This will include developing more types of visualizations and enhancing the interactivity of the visual interface to provide users with a more immersive and efficient data exploration experience.

- Additionally, continuous optimization of the overall performance and stability of the enhanced SWMM engine will be carried out to ensure its reliable operation in large-scale and complex water system simulation scenarios.
